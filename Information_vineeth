To power the Digital AI Assistant with accurate, real-time, and contextual answers, we need structured, backend-level data that goes beyond whatâ€™s visible on the website.

The AI assistant must respond to queries across Devices, Plans, and Promotions and also handle comparisons, FAQs, and eligibility rules. For this, we require consistent API responses (or JSON/CSV exports) covering the following:

ðŸ”¹ Devices

Device ID, Brand, Model, Category

Release Date, Specs (Screen, Camera, Storage, OS, Chipset)

Available Colors, Variants, Virtual Device Flag

Associated Promotions & Eligible Plans

Device Support/IoT/Coverage device metadata

Links (overview page, support page), Images/Thumbnails

ðŸ”¹ Promotions

Promotion ID, Title, Category, Sub-Category

Start & End Dates, Status (Active/Expired/Future)

Requirements (new line, port-in, trade-in, etc.)

Payout Type & Value (rebate, credit, discount, free months)

Applicable Plans / Devices / Accessories

SOC Group details if relevant

Links, Assets (banners, thumbnails), Notes

ðŸ”¹ Plans

Plan ID, Name, Price Per Line (1â€“10 lines)

Features: 5G Data, Hotspot, Roaming, Priority Data, Add-ons

Eligibility Rules (business size, prepaid/postpaid, line limits)

Included vs. Not Eligible Conditions

Associated Devices & Promotions

FAQ Metadata per plan


ðŸ”¹ Cross-Relationships & Additional Needs

Deviceâ€“Planâ€“Promotion Mappings (many-to-many eligibility matrix)

Plan Comparison Data (side-by-side features, add-ons, pricing tiers)

Structured FAQs grouped by plan, device, and promotion

Business Rules / Eligibility Logic (minimum lines, trade-in combos, discount stacking)

This information will allow us to:

Avoid misinformation/hallucinations

Improve customer experience by delivering contextually correct responses
