## ‚úÖ What You Can Scrape vs. What Needs to Be Asked

| **Type**                     | **Can Scrape**                          | **Need to Ask for via API / Data Export**                      |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Plan Names, Prices, Features | ‚úÖ Yes                                   | ‚ùå Usually partial, often hardcoded text or split across tabs   |
| Device-Plan Linking          | ‚ùå No                                    | ‚úÖ Not always visible on page, often business logic based       |
| Promo-Plan Mapping           | ‚ùå No                                    | ‚úÖ Not always exposed in frontend, must be backend relationship |
| Full Comparison Tables       | ‚ùå No                                    | ‚úÖ Often generated via JS/UI dynamically                        |
| Eligibility Logic            | ‚ùå Partially (e.g., ‚Äúonly for business‚Äù) | ‚úÖ Full matrix of rules usually internal/backend                |

## üîé Examples of "Missing but Crucial" Information You Should Ask For

### 1. üß© Plan-Device-Promotion Relationship Mapping

> **Ask For:**
>
> * Which devices are eligible for which plans?
> * Which promotions apply only when user selects a certain plan **and** device combo?
>
> **Why:**
>
> * The chatbot should respond to queries like:
>   *‚ÄúWhich plans get me a free Pixel 10 with trade-in?‚Äù*
>   *‚ÄúIf I go with Unlimited Plus, what devices are eligible for rebates?‚Äù*

---

### 2. üìä Full Plan Comparison Matrix

> **Ask For:**
>
> * Export or API that provides **side-by-side** plan features like:
>
>   * Hotspot limit, Roaming, Priority Data, Price per line (1 to 10)
>   * Add-on pricing (like international calling)
>
> **Why:**
>
> * Supports queries like:
>   *‚ÄúCompare Business Unlimited vs Magenta Max‚Äù*
>   *‚ÄúWhich plan gives 50GB hotspot and Canada roaming?‚Äù*

---

### 3. üìö FAQs and Contextual Answers

> **Ask For:**
>
> * Export of plan-specific FAQs from the website‚Äôs help section
> * Grouped by plan/device/promotion where possible
>
> **Why:**
>
> * These cover edge cases like:
>   *‚ÄúWhat if I already have a line?‚Äù*
>   *‚ÄúHow long does the rebate take?‚Äù*
>   *‚ÄúCan I combine this with a student discount?‚Äù*

---

### 4. üß† Business Rules / Eligibility Logic

> **Ask For:**
>
> * Matrix or rule engine logic:
>
>   * Plan X only for business users with 5+ lines
>   * Promo Y only if device is purchased with EIP
>   * Accessory offer valid only for iPhone models
>
> **Why:**
>
> * Helps with **guardrails** and reduces hallucination risk

## üì® Sample Message to Ask for These in a Meeting or Email

> Hi Team,
>
> As we build the RAG-based AI Assistant for TFB, we‚Äôve identified a few critical pieces of information that aren‚Äôt fully accessible through scraping, but are essential for providing accurate and contextual responses to users:
>
> ### üîπ Specific Requests:
>
> 1. **Device‚ÄìPlan‚ÄìPromotion mappings** (many-to-many eligibility matrix)
> 2. **Plan comparison data** (side-by-side feature availability, pricing, add-ons)
> 3. **Structured FAQs** per plan/promo/device
> 4. **Business rules/eligibility logic** (e.g., which plans are valid for what business sizes, trade-in combinations, virtual device availability)
>
> If available via API or internal export (CSV, JSON), we can build a cleaner ingestion pipeline and avoid hallucinations or incorrect responses.
>
> We can also provide a structured schema for how this can be shared, or align with your data owners to finalize that. Let us know what‚Äôs feasible.

Would you like me to draft a **consolidated table or slide** summarizing:

* Device fields
* Promotion fields
* Plan fields
* Relationships (plan-device-promo)
* Missing info to request

For your meeting? Just say ‚Äúyes, prepare slide-ready summary‚Äù ‚úÖ
